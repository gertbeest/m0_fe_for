# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
    -I'm not really there yet. I thought I had it down earlier today but got confused on some things.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    -Very honestly - I felt stupid the entire time I was trying to complete these challenges and used a lot of outside help. It was all unproductive struggle because I was so stressed out because I'm already turning this in late, so I don't think I absorbed much of it.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    -I need to go over the entire lesson on for statements again. I have already given myself hours to do this, including this whole weekend.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    -I will reread the lesson over again and watch the video explanation again. I can't seem to differentiate between the types of for statements, when to use them, etc.
